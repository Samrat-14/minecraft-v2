# Minicraft

Minicraft is a simplified and primitive version of Minecraft built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Three.js. The project showcases an early implementation of voxel-based terrain generation, player interaction, and block manipulation, focusing on modular and modern web development practices. Perfect for exploring the fundamentals of game development in the web ecosystem.

## ðŸ“‹ Key Features

- **Infinite Terrain Generation**: Create an endless voxel-based world dynamically as the player explores, offering seamless and uninterrupted gameplay.

- **Optimized Rendering with InstancedMesh**: Leverages Three.js InstancedMesh to minimize draw calls, allowing for the efficient rendering of thousands of blocks.

- **Biome Generation with Simplex Noise**: Generate realistic and diverse biomes such as tundra, temperate zones, jungles, and deserts using simplex noise algorithms.

- **Terrain Generation with Noise**: Procedurally generate detailed and varied terrain features, including hills, valleys, and flatlands, using configurable noise parameters.

- **Interactivity with Add/Remove Blocks**: Players can interact with the world by adding or removing blocks, enabling creative construction and terrain modification.

- **Chunk-Based World Management**: Divide the world into manageable chunks for efficient memory usage and rendering, facilitating smooth gameplay.

- **Async Chunk Loading with Draw Distance**: Dynamically load and unload chunks asynchronously based on player position, showing only the visible chunks within a configurable draw distance.

- **Fog and Lighting Effects**: Enhance visual realism with fog effects and dynamic lighting, adapting to player movement and terrain features.

- **Modular and Extensible Design**: Built with modern web development tools, enabling future feature expansions and integrations.
